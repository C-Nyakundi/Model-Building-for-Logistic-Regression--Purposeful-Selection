To improve the predictive power of a model with an AUC of 0.625, you can consider the following strategies:

1. Feature Engineering
Add New Predictors: Explore additional features that might have predictive power. These could include interaction terms (combinations of variables), non-linear transformations (e.g., log or square transformations), or more granular demographic, socioeconomic, or health-related variables that might influence timely complementary feeding.
Create Interaction Terms: Some variables may interact in ways that impact the outcome. For instance, an interaction between food_insecurity and education might influence feeding practices differently than each variable alone.
Include Polynomial Terms: If relationships between predictors and the outcome are non-linear, polynomial terms (e.g., age squared) could improve fit.

2. Data Transformation and Scaling
Normalize or Standardize Features: Scaling numeric variables can sometimes improve model performance, especially for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of input data.
Transform Skewed Data: Apply transformations (e.g., log or Box-Cox transformations) to features with skewed distributions, which may help linearize relationships with the outcome variable.

3. Feature Selection
Remove Irrelevant or Redundant Features: Irrelevant or highly correlated features can add noise to the model. Use methods like backward elimination, forward selection, or LASSO regularization to select only the most impactful features.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): If your dataset has a high-dimensional feature space, PCA or other dimensionality reduction techniques can capture important patterns and help reduce noise.

4. Change the Model Type or Algorithm
Try a More Complex Model: Logistic regression may not capture complex relationships well. Try more flexible models like random forests, gradient boosting machines (GBM), or support vector machines (SVM) which may capture non-linear relationships more effectively.
Use Ensemble Methods: Models like random forests or ensemble stacking combine predictions from multiple models, often improving prediction accuracy.

5. Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameters for your model, especially if using models like GBM or SVM.
Cross-Validation: Perform k-fold cross-validation to obtain a more reliable estimate of model performance, helping to avoid overfitting or underfitting.

6. Balance the Classes
Address Class Imbalance: If one class (e.g., timely feeding) is much more common than the other, consider techniques to address imbalance. These could include undersampling the majority class, oversampling the minority class, or using methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

7. Refine the Outcome Variable
Check for Potential Misclassification: Ensure that the outcome variable accurately represents timely versus untimely feeding. Sometimes, redefining the target variable or adjusting its thresholds can provide clearer signals for the model.

8. Evaluate Model with Additional Metrics
Examine Precision, Recall, and F1 Score: AUC is a good starting point, but consider also monitoring precision, recall, or the F1 score, especially if the cost of false positives or false negatives is high.
Improving the modelâ€™s AUC requires an iterative approach of exploring new variables, testing alternative model structures, and adjusting data processing methods.
